### Summary
This project use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.  
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. We used "classe" variable in and other variables in the training set to predict. The final prediction model built from the project was used to predict 20 different test cases.
